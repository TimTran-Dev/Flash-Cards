# Flash Card Web APP Project


### Goal: 

A Web App that allows users to input questions and answers to those questions. When you click submit, it will post your questions, but hide the answer. This allows the user to be able to active recall the answer to that question. When the user needs to know the answer, they can simply click "get the answer" and the answer will appear. The user can then click on "generate random question", and it will give the user another random question. The user can update the question and answer by simply clicking on the text and editing the text. Next you will need to click on the the pencil w/paper icon and it will update the database. If the user wants to delete the question and answer, they can click on the trash can icon to remove it from the database.
